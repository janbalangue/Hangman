# Hangman - Classical Edition

Use your keyboard to enter the missing letters in the puzzle. Wrong letters will appear in the **Wrong Guesses** section. The number of guesses left will appear in the **Guesses Left** section. The system keeps a tally of total wins and losses.

See what happens when you get the correct answer and then *click the popup*! Good luck!
